# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Bridging Digital Intelligence and the Physical World Constitution

## Core Principles

### Completeness & Deployability
The book MUST be 100% complete, beautiful, and deployable on GitHub Pages using this Spec-Kit Plus template.

### Chapter Structure & Content
The book MUST contain exactly 13 main chapters following the official Panaversity course outline (Weeks 1–13). Every chapter MUST have frontmatter, Mermaid diagrams, code examples, Key Takeaways, and a Practice Assignment.

### RAG Chatbot Integration
The final deliverable MUST include a working embedded RAG chatbot (to be added later, but reserve space for it).

### Clarity, Correctness & Visual Appeal
Prioritise clarity, correctness, and visual appeal over length.

### Runnable Code Snippets
All code snippets MUST be real and runnable (ROS 2 Python, URDF, launch files, etc.).

### Target Audience & Tone
Tone: university-level but beginner-friendly, written for Pakistani students.

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other project practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All Pull Requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles.
