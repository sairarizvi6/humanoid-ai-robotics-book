  "description": "Physical AI is an emerging field that combines artificial intelligence with robotic systems, allowing machines to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world. Unlike traditional AI, which often operates within digital confines, Physical AI empowers robots to perform tasks in real-world environments, requiring them to handle uncertainty, adapt to changing conditions, and make decisions based on sensory input. This introductory chapter will lay the groundwork for understanding what Physical AI entails, its historical context, and its profound implications for the future.",
