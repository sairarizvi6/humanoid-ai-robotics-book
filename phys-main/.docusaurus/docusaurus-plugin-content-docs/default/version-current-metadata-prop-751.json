Embodied intelligence posits that an agent's physical body, its sensory-motor capabilities, and its interactions within the environment are not just incidental to, but fundamentally constitutive of its intelligence. Humanoid robots, with their human-like form and capabilities, serve as a compelling platform to explore these ideas, offering unique challenges and opportunities in the quest for truly intelligent machines.",

Unlike traditional AI, which often operates within digital confines, Physical AI empowers robots to perform tasks in real-world environments, requiring them to handle uncertainty, adapt to changing conditions, and make decisions based on sensory input. This introductory chapter will lay the groundwork for understanding what Physical AI entails, its historical context, and its profound implications for the future.",
